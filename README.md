# GOBs-of-Fun
Goal-Oriented Behavior DV


Sadly, because several new versions of ML-Agents had come out since the tutorial, I wasn't able to get the Penguin to actually learn how to fish...or even move.  

At least my fish move around. Thus, my DV is two penguins watching three fish swim around, which is a result of completing the tutorial through step 3.

Unfortunately, only the fish move. NOTE: this is MY final result of MY work.
